Game Name: The Loud Quiet <br>
Date Completed: May 1, 2022
We decided to go with a vertical endless runner type platform game where the player
climbs up a skyscraper with platforms by it as windowsills and they have to avoid
certain obstacles like bombs falling here and there or the winds blowing them down
and causes them to die. There is a powerup where they can advance up multiple platforms
that spawn at random areas of the skyscraper. The overall goal is to get to the negative
score and to go far into the negative score as much as possible before you die. We also
have sound effects for when the player collides with the powerups and the wind and for the 
jumping animation as well. All powerups, bombs, and wind effects are all animation created by 
us and it will spawn at random times during the game. Platforms will accelerate faster as you
get to the top of the skyscraper.
